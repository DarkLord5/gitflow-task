####**The Xiaomi Redmi Note 9s is made of Corning Gorilla Glass 5, which is glued to a plastic frame. Only recently I wrote that usually expensive glass does not cling to plastic frames. And already when I published it, I realized that I was mistaken. Xiaomi has been practicing this for a long time. The Redmi 8 Pro also came with a CGG5 and a plastic frame. A great way to give buyers premium materials while saving on chassis manufacturing. There are no complaints about plastic. It is a beautiful, durable and durable material.The build of the smartphone is excellent. This is indirectly confirmed by the fact that the specifications indicate that the smartphone is splash-proof. This means that everything is assembled and glued conscientiously.**

####**The design of the Redmi Note 9s is, as they say, classic. Otherwise it can not be. No one will engage in design innovations in a smartphone under 20 thousand. Stable and well-proven solutions are used. The back panel is mirrored, but thanks to Xiaomi that it is not flashy, but a pleasant soft color. Creates a light 3D illusion, visually appears to be thick and bulging, but not.**
